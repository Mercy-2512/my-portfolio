        I'm Mercy, a Computer Science engineer and Implementation Analyst at
        Athenahealth. I enjoy frontend development, data engineering, and
        building digital experiences that feel simple, intuitive, and meaningful.
      </p>

      <p className="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 max-w-2xl leading-relaxed">
        I’ve been part of clubs like GDSC and DEVS, where I organized events,
        managed projects, and collaborated with students from various domains.
        I’m also working on becoming a stronger frontend developer and data
        engineer — while secretly dreaming of opening my own aesthetic coffee
        shop in Chennai ☕.

        I'm Mercy, a Computer Science engineer and Implementation Analyst at
        Athenahealth. I enjoy frontend development, data engineering, and
        building experiences that feel simple and intuitive.

      <p className="text-slate-300 max-w-2xl">
        I’ve been part of clubs like GDSC and DEVS, where I organized events,
        managed projects, and collaborated across domains. I’m also working
        towards becoming a strong frontend developer and data engineer, while
        secretly dreaming about my own aesthetic coffee shop in Chennai ☕.
